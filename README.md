# Blue Riding Hood - 2D Game

Sebastian RÄƒzvan Pitica

This project represents the implementation of an innovative 2D game, "Blue Riding Hood", a creative reinterpretation of the classic "Little Red Riding Hood" story. The game explores the adventures of Blue Riding Hood, a new character introduced into the story's universe, in search of his cousin, Little Red Riding Hood.

## General Description

"Blue Riding Hood" is a single-player game structured across three levels, combining elements of maze exploration, combat, and collection. The player navigates through complex environments, faces various types of enemies, and collects coins to accumulate points. The ultimate goal is to confront the main antagonist, the wolf 'Za Walfo'.

Key features:

- Gameplay based on maze exploration and combat mechanics
- Scoring system based on defeating enemies and collecting coins
- Special abilities of the main character (temporary shield, sword attack)
- Variety of enemies with unique behaviors and resistances
- Three distinct levels with progressive difficulty

## Technical Aspects

The game was developed using:

- Object-oriented programming for a modular and extensible structure
- Databases for saving progress and loading level configurations
- Advanced pathfinding algorithms (Dijkstra) for enemy AI
- Design patterns such as Singleton, State, Memento, and Observer for a robust architecture

Notable technical features:

- System for saving and loading player progress
- Intuitive graphical interface
- Procedural generation of game elements (coin positions, enemies)
- Collision and interaction system between entities

## Conclusion

"Blue Riding Hood" represents a successful blend of classic narrative and modern game development technology. The project demonstrates the successful implementation of advanced programming concepts in the context of an engaging and original 2D game.
